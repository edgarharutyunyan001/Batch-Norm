Analyzing the Impact of Batch Normalization and Layer Normalization

Step 1: Implementing Batch Normalization:
Begin by creating a neural network architecture and incorporating Batch Normalization layers. Train the neural network twice: once with Batch Normalization enabled and once without it. Use the training and validation loss curves to assess the impact of Batch Normalization on model performance.

Step 2: Analyzing Batch Normalization Performance:
Compare the loss curves of the two training runs with and without Batch Normalization. Look for differences in convergence speed, stability, and final loss values. Document any observed improvements or drawbacks in model performance with Batch Normalization.

Step 3: Implementing Layer Normalization:
Repeat the process by integrating Layer Normalization layers into the neural network architecture. Train the neural network twice: once with Layer Normalization enabled and once without it. Utilize the training and validation loss curves to evaluate the effect of Layer Normalization on model performance.

Step 4: Analyzing Layer Normalization Performance:
Compare the loss curves of the two training runs with and without Layer Normalization. Examine differences in convergence speed, stability, and final loss values. Document any observed enhancements or limitations in model performance with Layer Normalization.

Step 5: Comparative Analysis:
Finally, compare the performance of Batch Normalization and Layer Normalization based on the documented observations. Determine which normalization technique resulted in better model performance in terms of convergence speed, stability, and final loss values.

Ensure thorough documentation of the experimental setup, including details of the neural network architecture, training procedure, and normalization techniques employed. Record and interpret the loss curves to provide meaningful insights into the impact of Batch Normalization and Layer Normalization on model training and performance.
